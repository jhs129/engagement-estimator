# SDD Progress Ledger

## Session Resume Instructions

To resume this work in a new session:
1. Open `/Users/johnhschneider/dev/engagement-estimator`
2. The branch is `feature/engagement-estimator`
3. Read this file to find the first task not marked complete
4. Read the full spec at `/Users/johnhschneider/.claude/plans/i-want-to-create-indexed-riddle.md`
5. Invoke skill `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` and execute from the first incomplete task
6. Phase 1 brief is already written at `.superpowers/sdd/phase1-brief.md` — dispatch the implementer using it

- Full spec/plan: `/Users/johnhschneider/.claude/plans/i-want-to-create-indexed-riddle.md`

## Minor Findings to Address at Final Review

(none yet)

## Notes

- Plan uses "Phase N" headings not "Task N" — the `task-brief` script won't parse it; write briefs manually to `.superpowers/sdd/phase<N>-brief.md`
- shadcn init: use `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init -y` or `--defaults` flag
- No real DB credentials available yet — implementer should use placeholder DATABASE_URL and skip migrations; just run `prisma generate`
- After Phase 1 completes, John will need to configure `.env.local` with real Neon DB URL, Google OAuth, and Entra ID credentials before Phase 2 can run migrations
